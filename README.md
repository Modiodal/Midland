# ucf_qmb_assignment

Originally created on 11/4/2019

Created this to simplify an assignment for class (QMB 3200) last semester. 

This was also my first 100 (or 99 if you're being picky) lines of code.

ps. I understand there are easier and condensed ways to complete this code but I want to show my progression for years to come.
